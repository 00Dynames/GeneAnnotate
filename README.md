# GeneAnnotate

    - GeneAnnotate is a python script that takes a gene sequence as a fasta file and aannotates it for ORF's and BLASTx matches
    - GeneAnnotate assumes that binftools (installed on CSE machines) is installed and available on your system
        - GeneAnnotate is dependent on getorf from the above 
        - Note: it should work if you have getorf and nothing else
     
    - use "-h" for help
